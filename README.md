An HD Wallet (Hierarchical Deterministic Wallet) is a type of cryptocurrency wallet that generates a tree-like structure of private keys and addresses from a single root seed. The idea is that you can derive many private keys and addresses from a single "master seed" (or "mnemonic") without needing to store each private key individually.
